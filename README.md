# Overview
This is free downloader for CNKI, you can search, download papers , journals, conference records in caj/kdh/.. formats (that 
means you should use **CAJViewer** to open the document).

BTW:
- *read the [notice](https://github.com/amyhaber/cnki-downloader#notice) before you get start*
- *no matter what this project always will die*
- *star please* :)
- *若出现http response 400错误，请坐等CNKI修复其接口服务器，若CNKI方面拒不修复，则此软件失效*（摊手状）
